Self-reflection: This was a fun project to bang out in one day.  Definetly was not easy at the start, but got the hang of a bunch of stuff and was able to reinforce some new things.  The project started out hard but became a lot simpler after the functionality was done.  I really enjoyed the project and was impressed with how I implemented some ideas.  Overall fun project.
